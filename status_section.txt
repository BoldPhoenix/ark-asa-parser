###  Implemented
- Player name extraction
- Character name extraction  
- Tribe name extraction
- Tribe member lists
- Player stats (level, experience, tribe membership)
- Multi-server scanning
- **Inventory parsing** (item names, quantities, quality, durability)

###  In Development
- Full player stats (health, stamina, weight, etc.) - Float/Double parsing groundwork started
- Deep dino data extraction (requires UE5 actor serialization protocol)
- Structure data extraction (requires UE5 actor serialization protocol)
- Real-time save file watching
- Historical data tracking
